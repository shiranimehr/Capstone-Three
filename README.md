# COVID-19 Detection Based on Chest X-ray

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has affected almost every country in the world. Several tests have been developed to detect the disease at different stages. However, these tests can be slow and/or costly.

Here investigate using patentsâ€™ chest X-ray to detect COVID-19.

Data is obtained from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset. This is a public open dataset of chest X-ray and CT images of patients which are positive or suspected of COVID-19 or other viral and bacterial pneumonias (MERS, SARS, and ARDS). Data has been collected from public sources as well as through indirect collection from hospitals and physicians. 

We utilize convolutional neural networks based on MobileNet.
